## [unreleased]
### Added
- Integration with [RacksDB](https://github.com/rackslab/RacksDB) to extract
  emulated cluster topology (#1).
- Support for debian12 (Debian bookworm) in OS images sources YAML file.
- Introduce `fhpc_addresses`, `fhpc_nodes`, `fhpc_emulator_mode` extra
  variables. The first is a hash with containers as keys and the list of IP
  addresses as values. The second is also a hash with node tags as keys and the
  list of nodes assigned with the tag in values. The third is a boolean set to
  true when `--slurm-emulator` option is set on `firehpc` command line.
- Possibility to run command with SSH paramiko library in addition to ssh binary
  executable.
- Add example RacksDB database.
- cli:
  - Support for tags to filter deployed configuration tasks.
  - Report cluster status in JSON format with `--json` option.
  - Add `--slurm-emulator` option to deploy and configure a cluster with
    emulated Slurm cluster nodes (only one admin node with up to 64k virtual
    compute nodes).
  - Introduce `fhpc-emulate-slurm-usage` command to emulate random usage of
    Slurm cluster.
  - Add `start` and `stop` commands to respectively start and stop all
    containers of an emulated cluster.
- conf:
  - Optional support of Rackslab developement deb repositories, disabled by
    default.
  - slurmweb role to install and setup Slurmweb, optional and disabled by
    default.
  - Support multiple Slurm accounts definitions with hierarchy and control of
    users membership.
  - Add tags on all roles.
  - Add variable for slurmrestd socket path in slurm role.
  - Support optional additional slurmdbd parameters.
  - Deploy SSH root private and public keys on admin.
  - Generate /etc/hosts with all cluster IP addresses and hostnames.
  - Add `nodeset_fold` and `nodeset_expand` Jinja2 filters.
  - Support Slurm emulation with fully virtual nodes (up to 64k).
- docs:
  - Mention `conf` command `--db`, `--schema` and `--tags` options in
    `firehpc(1)` manpage.
  - Mention `deploy` command `--db` and `--schema` options in `firehpc(1)`
    manpage.
  - Mention `status` command `--json` option in `firehpc(1)` manpage.
  - Mention new `start` and `stop` commands in `firehpc(1)` manpage.
  - Add manpage for `fhpc-emulate-slurm-usage`
  - Mention `conf` and `deploy` commands `--slurm-emulator` option in
    `firehpc(1)` manpage.

### Changed
- Replaced notion of zone in favor of cluster, both in CLI options and
  configuration variables names.
- Removed extra directory from source tree. It used to contain ansible
  machinectl connection plugin as Git submodule. This dependency is now injected
  in FireHPC as a package supplementary source in packages built by Fatbuildr.
- conf:
  - Declare SSH host keys valid for both containers FQDN and short hostname
    in system known hosts file.
  - Split ssh role in 3 steps: localkeys for local bootstrap, bootstrap to
    initialize files on containers with machinectl and main for normal
    operations with SSH (known_hosts, SSH root keys).
  - Replace hardcoded admin hosts by selection of first admin group member for
    LDAP server hostname and Slurm server.
  - Generate Slurm nodes and partitions based RacksDB database content.
- docs: Update after zoneâ†’cluster rename in CLI options.

### Fixed
- Check OS images argument in CLI against values available in OS images YAML
  file instead of hard-coded argparse choices.
- Storage service stop and removal.
- conf:
  - Open slurmd spool directory permissions to all users for running batch
    jobs scripts.
  - Manage home directories ownership and permissions, in addition to some their
    content.
  - Add missing common name in LDAP x509 TLS/SSL certificate.
- docs: Grammatical error and typos in `firehpc(1)` manpage
